# HexagonRy Coding Challenge

This project was developed for the Spring 2023 Coding Challenge for Hive Helsinki students. 
All the team members were new to webdev so we set a pretty big challenge for ourselves. We were able to render a simple website for our student association, with pages to view student profiles and blog posts.
We had hoped to integrate the 42 Network API using NextAuth.js, however our end product sues a local JSON file to mimic our handling of data.

Overall we are happy with what we learned from engaging with this challenge.

Our key learnings are: 

- Working on project as team
- Adjusting project scope
- Complexity of working with APIs
- Installing and setting up evironment for Next.js project
- Styling with Tailwind
- Creating and using React components
- Using React hooks
